# filesystem

My implementation of a mock filesystem for a *Data Structures* class. Contains implementations of **Set** (with BST), **Queue**, **SortedQueue**, and **Stack** (Linked-List). The filesystem operations are realized with the **Command** design pattern, which allow to implement an undo system, neat.
